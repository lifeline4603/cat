customizable antiaim toggles

a project aiming to make oink's antiaim more customizable and harder to resolve.

to do:
- pitch jitter (woob add enum support)
- fakelag conditions
- antiaim conditions/better air aa (woob add enum support)
- **rotate aa**

i love oink!!!

im currently working on **rotate aa**

what its supposed to do:
- change the aa degree for offset/static from X1 degree to X2 degree (for example, 90° to 70°) gradually.
- it goes back to X1 once it hits X2
- ill also be able to determine the speed of it with hopefully a slider.
- all because i love replicating hvh stuff on csgo on other games
